Wookie is a simple but quite powerful realtime search engine.

It works with data you write into elliptics which eliminates need
for separate setup of the external solution.
Wookie is created on top of Grape [1] realtime pipeline engine in elliptics [2].

It supports full-featured attribute search without relevance calculation,
but with simple API to build your own ranking mechanism.
Even more, one can create personalized attribute parsing which are not limited
by string/integer calculus.

Wookie is the realtime search engine which works with data you want to store
in elliptics, this means that after your data has been stored, it is guaranteed
that it will appear in the search indexes.

Wookie supports language detection and simple morphology.

This project was created to simplify decision for projects which want not only
to store data, but also to perform its processing. We created Grape realtime
processing engine for this purpose and Wookie search engine is a nice example
of how simple it is to work with it.
